# Freight-Cost-Analysis-Project
A data analysis project that explores freight shipment costs and delivery performance across multiple carriers and transport modes. The project highlights cost variances, operational inefficiencies, and actionable insights to support smarter logistics and supply chain decision-making.



📦 Freight Cost Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes freight shipment data to understand cost behavior, delivery performance, and operational efficiency across different routes, carriers, and transportation modes.
The goal is to identify cost overruns, delivery trends, and optimization opportunities using data analysis techniques.

The dataset contains 250 shipment records with details such as planned vs actual cost, distance, carrier, transport mode, and delivery status.

🎯 Objectives

Compare planned freight costs vs actual costs

Identify cost overruns and savings

Analyze delivery performance (on-time vs delayed)

Evaluate the impact of distance, carrier, and transport mode on cost

Generate insights that support logistics cost optimization

🧾 Dataset Description

🔍 Analysis Performed

Cost Variance Analysis

Difference between planned and actual costs

Carrier Performance Analysis

Cost efficiency by logistics provider

Mode of Transport Comparison

Cost and delivery differences between Air and Road

Distance vs Cost Relationship

Impact of shipment distance on total cost

Delivery Performance Review

On-time vs delayed shipments

📊 Key Insights (Sample)

Some carriers consistently exceed planned costs, indicating inefficiencies.

Air shipments generally cost more but tend to have faster delivery times.

Longer distances significantly increase actual freight costs.

Cost overruns are more frequent in specific routes and carriers.

(Insights may vary depending on further visualization and modeling.)
