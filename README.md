# 🚚 Freight Cost Analysis

## 📍 Overview
This project analyzes freight shipment data to understand cost behavior, delivery performance, and operational efficiency. The analysis compares planned and actual freight costs to identify inefficiencies, cost overruns, and opportunities for optimization across routes, carriers, and transport modes.

---

## 🧠 Business Problem
Freight and logistics costs often exceed initial estimates due to distance, delivery delays, and carrier inefficiencies. This project aims to uncover the key drivers of freight cost variations and provide insights that support better logistics planning and cost control.

## 📊 Key Results & Insights
1. Actual freight costs exceeded planned costs in a significant number of shipments, indicating cost control gaps.  
2. Longer shipment distances were strongly associated with higher freight costs.  
3. Air transport consistently recorded higher costs compared to road transport.  
4. Delayed deliveries were more likely to experience cost overruns.  
5. Certain carriers showed better cost efficiency than others.  
6. Cost variance differed noticeably across shipment routes.  
7. Shipments delivered on time generally had lower actual costs than delayed shipments.
